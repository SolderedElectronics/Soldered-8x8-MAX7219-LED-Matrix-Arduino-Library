The LED matrix 8x8 is a system of 64 interconnected LEDs that, with the help of the MAX7219 LED driver, light up as programmed, and all of this is located on one board and is truly easy to use. You can use them to show letters or symbols, display text, and the like. It is possible to connect several modules with just a few wires and control several matrices at once.

The design of the modules is such that they will look like they are from one piece, even if you stack several of them one after the other. The LEDs on the board are beautiful 0402 very small LEDs and give a very nice effect when lit.

- Voltage: 4.0V - 5.5V
- LED color: green
- Driver: MAX7219
- Dimensions: 54 x 22 mm
